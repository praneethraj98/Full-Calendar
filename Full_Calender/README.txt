FullCalendar is a jQuery plug in that provides a full-sized, drag & drop calendar.
We can add functionality as and when needed.
The above folder contains html files explaining the basics of full calendar functionality, provided from the documentation in the https://fullcalendar.io/docs website.

In order to run the files, pull the entire fullcalendar folder to your desktop and save all the files as well as the 'lib' library containing the CSS and JavaScript files of the fullcalendar
